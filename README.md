## Election Audit Overview
For this challenge, the dataset election_results is given by the Colorado Board of Elections to tabulate the total number of votes cast, the candidates names and their correlating number of votes cast for them, as well as the percentage of votes that each candidate recieved. From these we are able to obtain the projected winner of the election based on popular votes as well as the percent of votes the winner recieved. We also were requested to find the county with the largest voter turn out thus we analyzed the data to find the county with the largest voter turnout and their correlating vote percentage as well as total number of votes in that county.

## Election Audit Summary
This script can be used to examine an election csv file. To use for a different data source importing the correcr csv file instead of the colorado election results csv file can let you perform this analysis on that particular data set. Adjusting iterations through the rows in order to extract the correct data will depend on the csv file you embed into the analysis - in this case the candidate names are in the second row and the counties are in the first row, as displayed in the script for this analysis. Making sure youre iterating through the correct row will make an analysis available for any election results data.
